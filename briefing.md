<p class="briefing-lede"><strong>Your offices hear from industry, academia, and think tanks.</strong>
Hackers on the Hill brings a voice that's harder to find: the people who explore
new technology firsthand, spot risks early, and have no commercial agenda.</p>

<ul class="briefing-bullets">
  <li><strong>Early signal</strong> &mdash; researchers working with technology before it scales, catching issues before they become crises</li>
  <li><strong>Ground truth</strong> &mdash; real-world findings from the people who discovered remotely exploitable insulin pumps, vehicle braking flaws, and exposed water treatment systems</li>
  <li><strong>No agenda</strong> &mdash; all-volunteer, no sales, no lobbying, no talking points</li>

<h2>Wait&hellip; Hackers?</h2>

<p><strong>In the security community, a hacker is someone driven to understand how things
work&nbsp;&mdash; and to make them work better.</strong> Think of the engineer who reports cracks
in the bridge their family drives across. Creativity, curiosity, and concern for
others are cornerstones of this community.</p>

<p>These are the people who found that insulin pumps could be remotely manipulated,
that vehicle braking systems could be controlled through the entertainment
console, and that water treatment systems were exposed to the open internet. In
each case, they disclosed what they found in good faith so it could be fixed.</p>

<p>Academics study these problems, think tanks write about them, and industry sells
solutions. Hackers get their hands on technology early, spot issues early, and
prototype fixes. They are leading indicators that give savvy policymakers a head
start.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Why this matters for your office</h2>

<p><strong>Security researchers see the actual attack surface.</strong> They know which systems are
fragile, where the real risks are, and what's already being exploited. That
practical intelligence is the difference between legislation that looks good on
paper and legislation that actually works.</p>

<p class="briefing-evidence-intro">This approach already works. Researcher&ndash;policymaker collaboration has shaped real policy outcomes:</p>
