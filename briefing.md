<p class="briefing-lede"><strong>Effective policy depends on foresight</strong> to understand emerging risks and
opportunities before they arrive as crises. Your offices hear regularly from
industry, academia, and think tanks, and each brings real value. Hackers on the
Hill brings a voice that's harder to find: the early adopters who explore new
technology firsthand, ask the questions others don't, and anticipate consequences
(positive and negative) before they scale. No commercial agenda. No talking
points. Just candid conversation.</p>

<p>Since 2017, Hackers on the Hill, an all-volunteer initiative, has been building
trusted spaces where security researchers and policymakers work together on shared
challenges. We forge relationships, hold events, and facilitate ongoing
dialogue&nbsp;&mdash; grounded in shared values. No one gets paid. We just think policy works
better when the people making it have candid conversations with the people
living it.</p>

  <div class="briefing-impact-label">Since 2017</div>
  <p>Events on Capitol Hill, at the White House, and in Ottawa, London, and
  Colorado · Hundreds of researchers engaged · Dozens of policy briefings
  delivered · Topics include AI, ransomware, critical infrastructure, medical
  devices, IoT, encryption, supply chain security, and vulnerability
  disclosure · <strong>Global since 2024</strong></p>

<h2>Wait&hellip; Hackers?</h2>

<p>The word carries baggage. But in the security community, a hacker is someone
driven to understand how things work&nbsp;&mdash; and to make them work better. Think of the
kid who took apart the family radio, the mechanic who challenges herself to
diagnose an engine by sound, the engineer reporting cracks in the bridge their
family drives across, or the tinkerer innovating novel uses for technology that
aren't available on the market. Creativity, curiosity, dedication to a craft, and
concern for others are cornerstones of <em>our</em> hacker community the same way they are
of your local one.</p>

<p>Academics study these problems, think tanks write about them, and industry sells.
Hackers are driven to get their hands on technologies early and tend to spot
issues and opportunities early&nbsp;&mdash; and prototype ways to address them. Hackers are
leading indicators that give savvy policymakers a head start to shape technology
toward the best outcomes for society.</p>

<blockquote class="briefing-pullquote">
  <p>&ldquo;Effective policy is shaped by people who foresee consequences&nbsp;&mdash; positive and
  negative&nbsp;&mdash; firsthand. Not through reports, but with direct evidence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security researchers are driven by a mix of motivations&nbsp;&mdash; protecting people,
solving puzzles, professional pride, earning a living, or standing up for a
cause.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> But the researchers who show up to engage with policymakers are
overwhelmingly driven to <em>protect</em>&nbsp;&mdash; and they're giving their time to help you get
it right. These are the people who found that insulin pumps could be remotely
manipulated, that vehicle braking systems could be controlled through the
entertainment console, and that water treatment systems were exposed to the open
internet. In each case, they disclosed what they found in good faith so it could
be fixed.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for your office</h2>

<p>Effective cybersecurity policy requires understanding the technical reality on the
ground&nbsp;&mdash; not just position papers and industry testimony. Security researchers see
the actual attack surface. They know which systems are fragile, where the real
risks are, and what's already being exploited. That's the kind of practical
intelligence that makes the difference between legislation that looks good on
paper and legislation that actually works.</p>

<p>The security research community's engagement with policymakers has already
contributed to real outcomes:</p>

<h2>Work with us</h2>

<p>Hackers on the Hill isn't a one-day event&nbsp;&mdash; it's the start of a relationship.
After each gathering, we facilitate follow-up conversations, technical reviews of
draft legislation, and direct connections to subject-matter experts when your
office needs them.</p>

<p>If you're working on cybersecurity policy&nbsp;&mdash; healthcare, critical infrastructure,
AI, defense, consumer protection&nbsp;&mdash; we can connect you with researchers who have
deep, hands-on expertise in that specific area. Just people who know the
technology and want to help you get the policy right.</p>
