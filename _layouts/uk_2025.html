    <p>"Hackers in the House" is a UK edition of the well-established US-based "Hackers on the Hill", which has been forging greater collaboration between US policymakers and cybersecurity professionals for the past seven years. Hackers in the House will give UK security professionals a similar opportunity to meet policymakers and help inform and influence potential UK cyber policy development.</p>
    
    <p>Attendees will participate in briefings with civil servants who are working directly on developing cyber policy across the UK government. These are non-partisan professionals working for the UK government departments that set or influence policy relating to cybersecurity. If you are a cyber security researcher and/or practitioner, get involved, share your experience, and have your say!</p>
    
    <p>Hackers in the House has worked collaboratively with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), and various other UK government departments to organise briefings for our security community participants. They are keen to meet with experienced security professionals to better understand and navigate the complexities and realities of real world cybersecurity challenges.</p>
    
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Topics</h4>
    <p>Topics that may be covered include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The forthcoming <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-policy-statement">Cyber Security and Resilience Bill</a></li>
      <li>Adoption of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/evaluation-survey-for-the-software-security-code-of-practice">secure-by-design practices in software supply chains</a></li>
      <li>The proliferation and abuse of commercial hacking tools and services, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-code-of-practice-for-states">Pall Mall Process</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-cyber-security-code-of-practice">AI and cybersecurity</a></li>
      <li>Emerging cyber threats and priorities</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Who Should Attend</h4>
    <p>This event is aimed at security professionals with real-world operational experience of tackling cybersecurity threats and challenges, and an interest in shaping potential cyber policy outcomes. You do not need any policy experience as we will kick off the event with interactive sessions to help you get the lay of the land before you go into your government briefings. We also provide advice on how to engage in briefings.</p>
    
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Event Schedule</h4>
    <p>The event runs for most of the work day (with a late start to support travel needs), and afterwards, participants are invited to join us for the unofficial debriefing at a self-funded happy hour. Whether you continue to engage with policymakers and shape policy outcomes after that is up to you!</p>
