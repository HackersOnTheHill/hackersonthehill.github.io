          <h4 class="mt-5">What is Hackers on Parliament Hill?</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">Hackers on Parliament Hill brings cybersecurity practitioners and researchers together with Canadian Members of Parliament and government policymakers for constructive dialogue about cybersecurity policy. This initiative is rooted in the belief that bridging the gap between those who work directly with cybersecurity challenges in technical and operational roles and those who craft policy leads to better outcomes for everyone.</p>
          
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">Our participants include defenders, researchers, software developers, and others who actively secure systems, data, and infrastructure. Through in-person meetings and briefings, we create opportunities for policymakers to hear directly from the cybersecurity community about the realities of policy implementation and to build lasting relationships that extend far beyond the event itself.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Event Details</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">Hackers on Parliament Hill takes place over two days in November 2025, bringing together cybersecurity professionals for meetings with Members of Canadian Parliament and government officials. Participants will engage in direct conversation about policy priorities, emerging threats, and the role of technical expertise in shaping effective cybersecurity governance.</p>
          
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">On the evening of November 19th, join us for an informal happy hour at <strong>D'Arcy McGee's pub</strong> from <strong>4-7pm</strong> to network with fellow participants and organizers in a relaxed setting.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Policy Village at BSides Ottawa</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">As part of Hackers on the Hill's commitment to engaging the broader cybersecurity community, we are organizing the Policy Village at BSides Ottawa. The Policy Village is a constructive and welcoming space for knowledge exchange, relationship building, and mutual learning between cybersecurity practitioners and policymakers. These conversations are meant to continue beyond the Village walls, enriching both the cybersecurity field and Canadian policy discussions in lasting ways.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Core Principles</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">To maintain the integrity and effectiveness of Hackers on Parliament Hill and the Policy Village, all participants are expected to adhere to the following guiding principles:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Constructive Engagement</strong> — This is not a platform for endorsing or attacking specific bills, programs, or institutions. Instead, we focus on exploring underlying policy ideas, technical implications, and potential outcomes. The goal is to foster dialogue about principles and approaches, not advocacy for particular implementations. Critiques are welcome when delivered respectfully and constructively, with the intent of improving understanding.</li>
            
            <li><strong>No Shilling</strong> — This is a vendor-neutral space. No promotion of products, services, companies, or personal brands is permitted. Affiliated organizations may be mentioned for context but should not be promoted. Panels and presentations are selected based on their value to the community, not commercial interests.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Professional Conduct</strong> — All participants are expected to treat one another with respect. Any conduct that violates these values will result in removal from the event.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Why This Matters</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">Canada's cybersecurity future depends on mutual understanding and cooperation between technical experts and policymakers. Too often, these groups operate in silos. Hackers on Parliament Hill and the Policy Village exist to change that, creating trusted environments where meaningful connections and collaborations can be made.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Looking Forward</h4>
          <p class="m-0 mb-2">Interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and public policy? Whether you're a researcher, defender, public servant, policymaker, student, or newcomer to the space, there's a place for you in future editions of Hackers on the Hill. Follow us for announcements about upcoming events in 2026 and beyond.</p>
