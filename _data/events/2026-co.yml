faq:
  - question: What happens after I register my interest?
    answer: |
      Registering your interest lets us follow up with details as plans are finalized. It does not guarantee a spot.

      If we can accommodate you, you'll receive a confirmation email with next steps.
  - question: What is the photo/video policy? Do you allow press?
    answer: |
      Please ask before taking photos. We will announce participation guidelines at the event. Typically we hold the plenary on the record and the briefings off the record.

      Press attendance is handled separately for each event. If you are a member of the press and would like to attend, please get in touch.
  - question: Are there recommended hotels?
    answer: |
      We don’t have an official hotel block. If you’re visiting from out of town, most downtown Denver hotels are a short walk or ride from the Capitol - including the venue for <a href="https://wildwesthackinfest.com/wild-west-hackin-fest-mile-high-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild West Hackin' Fest @ Mile High</a>.
  - question: Can I bring a guest?
    answer: |
      Due to venue requirements and limited capacity, each attendee must register individually. Please do not bring unregistered guests.
  - question: What should I bring? What should I wear?
    answer: |
      Bring a government-issued photo ID for security screening. A notepad is useful; laptops are optional.

      Dress comfortably and consider layers for February weather.
