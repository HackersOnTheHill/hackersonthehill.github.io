faq: # FAQ list
  - question: What happens after I register my interest? # FAQ question
    answer: | # FAQ answer (markdown allowed)
      Registering your interest lets us follow up with details as plans are finalized. It does not guarantee a spot.

      If we can accommodate you, you'll receive a confirmation email with next steps.
  - question: Do you allow press? # FAQ question
    answer: | # FAQ answer (markdown allowed)
      Press attendance is handled separately for each event. If you are a member of the press and would like to attend, please get in touch.
  - question: Are there recommended hotels? # FAQ question
    answer: | # FAQ answer (markdown allowed)
      We don’t have an official hotel block yet. If you’re visiting from out of town, choose a nearby hotel for easy access.
  - question: Can I bring a guest? # FAQ question
    answer: | # FAQ answer (markdown allowed)
      Due to venue requirements and limited capacity, each attendee must register individually. Please do not bring unregistered guests.
  - question: What should I bring? What should I wear? # FAQ question
    answer: | # FAQ answer (markdown allowed)
      Bring a government-issued photo ID for security screening. A notepad is useful; laptops are optional.

      Dress comfortably and consider the weather.
