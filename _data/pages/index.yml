faq:
  - question: Who runs Hackers on the Hill?
    answer: |
      Hackers on the Hill, as a whole, is run by volunteers from the <a href="https://iamthecavalry.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Am The Cavalry</a> initiative - a group of dedicated individuals from the cybersecurity researcher community. Our goal is to share key resources for cybersecurity knowledge, broker connections to the community's expertise, and improve understanding among policymakers and technologists.

      Each location is run by locals who organize and manage their specific events to best serve their communities.
  - question: Who are these events for?
    answer: |
      Hackers on the Hill is for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners who want to inform policy with real-world experience. We also welcome policy-adjacent technologists who can contribute to technical discussions. Depending on space, we may also be able to open some events to a broader audience. This is a non-commercial event with a no-shilling policy.
  - question: What are the events like or what can I do to prepare for one? 
    answer: |
      Each local event is organized independently, so the format may vary. Generally, events include a plenary session with speakers from the cybersecurity and public policy communities, followed by meetings between attendees and policymakers. Check event pages for more details. Here's a little more info to help you understand what to expect and how to prepare:
      - Watch plenary sessions from past years on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hackersonthehill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hackers on the Hill YouTube channel</a>.
