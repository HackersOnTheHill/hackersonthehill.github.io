            <div class="faq-answer accordion-panel">
              <p>Hackers on the Hill, as a whole, is run by volunteers from the <a href="https://iamthecavalry.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Am The Cavalry</a> initiative - a group of dedicated individuals from the cybersecurity researcher community. Our goal is to share key resources for cybersecurity knowledge, broker connections to the community's expertise, and improve understanding among policymakers and technologists.</p>
              <p>Each location is run by locals who organize and manage their specific events to best serve their communities.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer accordion-panel">
              <p>Hackers on the Hill is for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners who want to inform policy with real-world experience. We also welcome policy-adjacent technologists who can contribute to technical discussions. Depending on space, we may also be able to open some events to a broader audience. This is a non-commercial event with a no-shilling policy.</p>

              <p>What to bring and to wear may differ event-by-event. Typically, we advise you to bring a government-issued photo ID for security screening where required. A notepad is useful; laptops are optional and may not be allowed into certain buildings.</p>
              <p>Dress in what you'll feel comfortable engaging your peers and policymakers you meet with, and according to the weather. Event pages will share any venue-specific rules or prohibited items.</p>
